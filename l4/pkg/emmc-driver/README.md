# L4Re eMMC server

emmc-driver is an L4Re server that consists of two parts. On one side there is
the hardware driver itself that communicates with the eMMC controller and
provides the interrupt handling. On the other side a libblock-device interface
has been implemented for interfacing with L4virtio clients.
