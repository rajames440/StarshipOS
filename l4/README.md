# L4Re Build System â€” StarshipOS Integration

This module wraps the upstream L4Re source tree and build system within a Maven-based structure
for StarshipOS.

It serves as the entry point for building the user-level runtime, boot environment, and ROMFS image
based on inputs provided by `starship-l4-deps`.

---

## ðŸ”§ What This Module Does

* Extracts `starship-l4-deps` into a build staging area
* Uses Maven plugin `starship:build-l4` to invoke the L4Re native `make` system
* Links against prebuilt kernel and JDK assets
* Generates a bootable image (e.g., ISO or QEMU-ready) with a `romfs`

### Build Output (Post-Compile)

* ROMFS-ready binaries and JARs in `build/`
* ISO or ELF images in `build/x86_64/`
* Log and dependency trace artifacts
